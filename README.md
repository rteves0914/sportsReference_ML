# sportsReference_ML

In this project, I will pull in data from the Major League Baseball using the sports-reference API. 

Using this data, I will look at the career statistics from every player that has ever played in the league, and use this data to predict whether or not a player deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.

I use a Linear Regression and/or Logistic Regression Machine Learning model to make these predictions.

The model is then measured using accuracy and precision and is deployed to a static Github page.
